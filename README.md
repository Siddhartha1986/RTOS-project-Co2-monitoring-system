# Hackathon in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences for Vaisala Oy.

Controlling the level of CO2 flow to the greenhouse was controlled using a rotary encoder and a valve.

Concepts of an RTOS, such as multitasking, were used. C and C++ were also used.

The free IoT Cloud platform ThingSpeak was used to create a dashboard to monitor the sensor readings and the state of the valve. The microcontroller used was the LPC 1549.
